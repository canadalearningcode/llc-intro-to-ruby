        We're going to be data scientists!

        We'll learn to process, manipulate, and sort data using open datasets from [open.canada.ca](http://open.canada.ca). These programs that 'parse' data are used in web apps such as [Open Parliament](https://openparliament.ca/).

        Today, you'll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights from open data provided by The Government of Canada.

        #Interactive Ruby (IRB)

        The *console* is an interactive tool used to test and debug code.
        Let&rsquo;s open IRB in the *console*:

        | Windows  |  Mac |
        |---|---|
        | Open Interactive Ruby from the Ruby section of your Start Menu.  | Open **Applications > Utilities > Terminal**. <br>Type `irb` and hit enter. |

        Now that it's open and running in the console, you'll see this *prompt*:
        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0>
        ```
        You can enter Ruby instructions after the prompt and press the Enter or Return key to *evaluate* them. A value is returned back to you, and then another prompt is displayed:

        ```ruby
        irb(main):001:0> "Hello!"
        => "Hello!"
        irb(main):002:0>

        * [and many more!](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming/Data_types)

        To figure out the type, add `.class` after the data value.

        #Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
          * Defined by wrapping the instructions between `def` and `end`
          * Directly after `def` is the name of the function
        * Function can take **arguments** and **return** values
          * After the function name, **arguments** are defined in parentheses, `()`
        * Functions always `return` 1 thing or a set of things

        ```ruby
        def functionName(arg1, arg2)
          set of instructions
          return answer
        end

        #Define the function

        This doesn't actually run the code.  We're just telling the computer what to expect.

        In the below example, the `add` function takes `a` and `b` as arguments and will **return** the result.

        ```ruby
        irb> def add(a, b)
        ...      return a + b
        ...  end
        ...

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Call the function

        After *defining* the function, *call* it by typing the name of the function, `add()` and substituting values where the arguments were defined `(a,b)`.

        ```ruby
        irb> add(1, 2)
        => 3
        ```

        The benefit is now we can sub in any 2 numbers without having to rewrite the code.

        ```ruby
        irb> add(3, 4)
        => 7
        ```
        We won't create our own functions in today's exercises, but we'll use those provided by ruby and its libraries.

        #Outputting values: `puts`

        The `puts` **function** outputs values to the screen.

        Reminder, use of quotes for *string* data types.

        ```
        irb> puts "Hello World!"
        Hello World!

        #Outputting values: `print`

        The function `print` can also be used to output values.

        The difference between `puts` and `print` is `puts` adds a new line to end of the output and `print` does not.

        ```
        irb> puts 2 + 2
        4
        => nil
        ```
        ```
        irb> print 2 + 2
        4=> nil
        ```
        Notice the `nil` remains on the same line as the response?

        Let's try it in IRB!
        ```
        irb> print "Hello World!"
        Hello World!=> nil

        #What's nil? It's nothing, don't worry.

        Remember how **Functions** always return 1 thing?

        Well, `print` and `puts` are functions.  However, since they only print to the screen they *technically* don't return anything.

        Since Ruby always needs to return something, it returns `nil`, which is computer for **nothing**.

        #Concatenation

        Ruby comes with a whole set of predefined functions.  These are sets of code that are so regularly used by most programmers that it makes sense for them to be part of the programming language itself.

        One such function is **concatenation**. With this we can "add" strings together. We call this function using the `+` symbol.

        ```
        irb> print "Ladies " + "Learning " + "Code"
        Ladies Learning Code => nil
        ```

        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```ruby
        irb> print 2 + "2"
        TypeError: String cannot be coerced into Fixnum

        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Why did that error happen?

        Ruby needs to know the **type** of data the value is to figure out how to work with it.  Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.

        ```ruby
        irb> print 2 + "2"
        TypeError: String cannot be coerced into Fixnum
        ```

        * The first `2`, inside of `print 2 + "2"` is an integer.
        * `"2"` enclosed in the quotes, is a **string** type, or "literal text".
        * Ruby can&rsquo;t add a number and string, so it spits out an error.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting: Strings to Numbers

        Ruby can convert the string `"2"` into a number and *change the type*.

        To change the string to an integer (whole number) using the `.to_i` function.  Try it in your console.

        ```
        irb> print 2 + "2".to_i
        4 => nil
        ```
        `to_i` is another predefined function in Ruby.
        It converts a string to an integer.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Dot Notation

        The most common way we call functions is with **dot notation**.

        In other words, add a period, then the function name *after* the object you want to call it on.

        For example:

        ```ruby
        "5".to_i
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Numbers

        Now try dividing 2 numbers and see what value gets returned:

        ```
        irb> print 1 / 2
        0 => nil
        ```
        This happens because Ruby sees 2 integers and will return an integer. Integer **classes** don&rsquo;t have decimal parts, so it must be converted to **floats**, since this number **class** can handle decimals.

        Use dot notation and the `.to_f` function.
        ```
        irb> print 1.to_f / 2.to_f
        0.5 => nil
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting: Numbers to Strings

        Ruby can also be used to convert numbers to strings.

        ```
        irb> print 3 + " items in my bento!"
        TypeError: String cant be coerced into Fixnum

        ```
        Use the `.to_s` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        irb> print 3.to_s + " items in my bento!"
        3 items in my bento! => nil

        ```

        #Variables
        In programming, we usually want to store a value to use later.
        **Variables** store data in your computer&rsquo;s memory.

        Use a **variable name** to fetch their value (kind of like a bookmark in a book). The equal (`=`) symbol *assigns* a value to a variable.

        Let's go over these example:

        ```ruby
        irb> x = 5
        irb> y = 4
        irb> x * y
        => 20
        ```

        ```ruby
        irb> today = "Saturday"
        irb> print "Today is " + today
        Today is Saturday => nil
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after you&rsquo;ve assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```ruby
        # Remember, we've already set x = 5 and y = 4
        irb> y = 10
        irb> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">50</span>

        Why?
        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.
        Ruby will remember variable names until you close IRB.

        # Variable naming conventions

        * Can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`); no spaces
        * Words can be separated with an underscore `_`
        i.e. `ladies_learning_code`
        * Cannot begin with a number
        i.e. `1day` gives you an error while `day1` is fine

        The names we&rsquo;ll use today are descriptive, but otherwise have no special meaning to Ruby.

        #Working with user input

        So far, we&rsquo;ve used the console to output message on the screen. Now let's write a program that can say hello to anyone!

        Use the `gets` method to receive data typed into the console. Then you'll see a blank line and the cursor. Type your name in the blank line.

        ```ruby
        irb> gets
        Sarah
        ```
        Ruby returns the name plus a `\n`. (We'll deal with the `\n` later.)

        ```ruby
        => "Sarah\n"
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Working with user input: Variables

        Generally, we set the value returned by `gets` to a **variable**.

        ```ruby
        # Set variable 'name' to value of 'gets'
        irb> name = gets
        ```

        Then add your name to the blank line.
        ```ruby
        # Set variable 'name' to value of 'gets'
        irb> name = gets
        # Add a value for 'name'
        Sarah
        ```

        Now, *call* the variable using `name` and it will return the assigned value.

        ```ruby
        irb> name
        => "Sarah\n"
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #What is `\n`?

        `\n` is Ruby's way of putting a *new line* after the input.
        Use the method `chomp` to remove the last character of a string.

        Let's create a program in the console that will remove the `\n` character.

        1.&nbsp;Give a `puts` message to let your user know what you&rsquo;re looking for.
        ```ruby
        irb> puts "What is your name?"
        ```
        ```ruby
        #outputs:
        What is your name?
        => nil
        ```

        2.&nbsp;Define a `name` variable and assign the value of `gets` to it.
        Add `chomp` to remove the new line character.
        ```ruby
        irb> name = gets.chomp
        ```

        3.&nbsp;Type your name in the blank line and hit the **enter** key. The value will be  *returned* to you.

        ```
        irb> name = gets.chomp
        Sarah
        => "Sarah"
        ```

        4.&nbsp;Type the variable `name` and **enter**.

        ```ruby
        irb> name
        => "Sarah"
        ```

        The name *value* is now assigned to the *variable* and will return without the `\n` character!

        #Working with a Text Editor

        Typing into the console is fine to start, but do you really want to type your program every time you run it?

        Let's open our **exercises** folder in Atom to get ready to work in the text editor instead of the console. This will also make it easier to write larger blocks of code.

        Inside of the folder you downloaded today, there a few other folders.

        ```

            |-- solutions // Solutions for the exercises.
          |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation, do not edit!
          |-- slides.html // This is the file you are viewing right now!
        ```

        Open Atom and go to **File > Add Project Folder**.

        ![](framework/img/workshop/add-project-1.jpg)

        A popup will appear. Then:

        * navigate to the **llc-intro-to-ruby-data-master** folder
        * select **exercises** and click **Open**

        Ruby can run your code from a file with a `.rb` **extension**
        *(<!-- .element: class="note" -->the letters after `.` in a filename tell your computer which program can run it)*

        Let&rsquo;s create our first Ruby file!

          ![Create a new ruby File](./framework/img/workshop/saving-ruby-file.png)

        1. Enter the name `hello.rb` in the popup box. Make sure to save it into your **exercises** folder.

        1. Now we can add our program to the Ruby file.

          ```ruby
          # Ask user for input
          print "Please enter your name: "

          # Assign the input value to a variable
          # Your program waits for the user to hit enter
          name = gets.chomp

          # ... then continues to this line

        `ls` is used to **List** the files in the current directory

        # Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Code in a file is just text until you **run** it through the Ruby program.

        We'll need to navigate to the location of your saved **hello.rb** file using `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list files).

        Open a new tab in the console. The directory location will default to your user directory and will look something like this:

        ```
        Computer-Name:~ yourusername$
        ```

        Type `ls` at the end of this line to list the directories.

        If you saved today's files to your *desktop*, type the command `cd Desktop` to navigate to that folder.

        ```
        Computer-Name:~ yourusername$ cd Desktop
        ```

        Navigate only to the **exercises** folder (not the `hello.rb` file).

        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        You can continue to use `cd` and `ls` to get to your *exercises* directory OR just type `cd` and *drag* the folder from your Finder/Explorer into the console!

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Once in the **exercises** directory, type `ruby hello.rb` and hit `Enter` to run your program.
        ```
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$ ruby hello.rb
        ```

        The program should now execute the first line in the `hello.rb` file and ask for your name.

        Type in your name and hit `Enter` again and it will say hello to you. It will look something like this:

        ```
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$ ruby hello.rb
        Please enter your name: Trudy
        Hello Trudy
        Computer-Name:exercises yourusername$
        ```

        You can run your program as many times as you like by repeating the steps above. Or try changing the greeting in the **hello.rb** file!

        How does `if` know what&rsquo;s `true` or `false`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```ruby
        irb> weather = "raining"
        ```

        To test the values, the double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        irb> weather == "cold"
        => false
        irb> weather == "raining"

        # Testing numbers with Math Comparison Operators

        Just as you could check the exact value of a string or number you can use typical math operators to check relative numeric values

        `>`: Greater than  
        `<`: Less than  
        `>=`: Greater than or equal to  
        `<=`: Less than or equal to

        We have a couple of `.csv` files from <a href=http://open.canada.ca>open.canada.ca</a> in the exercises folder. Let's try opening and reading the `no-emissions.csv` file.

        ```ruby
        irb> emissions = File.open(".../llc-intro-to-ruby/exercises/no-emissions.csv")
        irb> puts emissions.read()

        # One line at a time

        In order to make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions of data at a time.

        In the `no-emissions.csv` file, each line of the file represents a country and the amount of nitrogen oxide emissions during a period of time. 
        
        Let&rsquo;s print out a few individual lines.

        ```ruby
        irb> emissions = File.open('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        irb> puts emissions.readline()
        => "\"Nitrogen oxide emissions by country, 2002 and 2012\",,,,\r\n"

        irb> puts emissions.readline()
        => ",,,,\r\n"

        irb> puts emissions.readline()
        => "Country,2002 Nitrogen oxide emissions (kilotonnes),2012 Nitrogen oxide emissions... etc."

        irb> puts emissions.readline()
        => "United States,21632,12258,1.8,0.9\r\n"

        # Reading all the lines in a file

        It&rsquo;s all well and good to print out the lines in a file one-at-a-time, but surely, there&rsquo;s a better way to read *all* the lines in a file.

        To perform the same action many times in a row, use **loops**. In Ruby, there are lots of types of loops! 
        
        The example below uses a `for` loop to print each of the rows in the file.

        # Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        Let's take a closer look at the first few lines in the file `no-emissions.csv`:

        ```
        1. "Nitrogen oxide emissions by country, 2002 and 2012",,,,
        2. ,,,,
        3. Country,2002 Nitrogen oxide emissions (kilotonnes),2012 Nitrogen oxide emissions (kilotonnes),2002 Nitrogen oxide emissions intensity (tonnes per million US$ GDP),2012 Nitrogen oxide emissions intensity (tonnes per million US$ GDP)
        4. United States,21632,12258,1.8,0.9
        ```

        The first line is the title of the file, the second a space, the third is a legend, and the fourth is the first entry.

        Notice that all three lines have columns, separated by a comma (`,`)

        Dividing columns by commas is called Comma Separated Values, or **CSV** that is used to represent spreadsheet-like data.

        ---
        <!-- .element: class="note" -->**Note**: This is a widely used file-format because it&rsquo;s such a simple representation of rows and columns of data. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re on a Mac, Windows, Linux or even on a web app like Google Docs â€“ everyone can use this data.

        # Libraries

        Ruby has wonderful built in **libraries** which are collections of code that other people have written. Today we&rsquo;ll use the **csv** library. It contains instructions that tell Ruby how to work with CSV files.

        This library will help us makes sense of the data contained in a CSV file to learn more from Canada's Open Data.

        # Using a library

        So far, we've been writing all our code in the console or in one file. When you use a library, you don't want to copy all that code into your file, otherwise it would become huge!

        In Ruby, you can **require** the functions and other structures so you can use the code without having it in your file. Then you can use functions (and other structures) to do your bidding!

        In your console, import the `csv` library as follows.

        ```ruby
        irb> require 'csv'
        ```
<!-- TEMP: I don't think you can do this in IRB
        If you then type `csv.` and wait, it will show you a list of everything in that module.

        # Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV library helps us access comma-separated-values using row and column numbers:

        * Import the `csv` library,
        * Read the data from the file using the library (`CSV.read`),
        * Access data by row and column (`data[row][column]`)

        ```ruby
        irb> require 'csv'
        irb> data = CSV.read('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        irb> data[4][0]
        => "Canada"
        irb> data[4][1]
        => "2529"
        irb> data[4][2]
        => "1862"
        ```

        # Arrays

        The CSV library provides data using Arrays. Array is another fundamental data type that represents a sequence of items.

        CSV data is an Array of rows, and each row is an Array of Strings (the comma-separated values).

        The position of an item in an Array is called an 'index', and the first item has index 0 (think distance from beginning).


        ```ruby
        irb> require 'csv'
        irb> data = CSV.read('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        => [["Nitrogen oxide emissions by country, 2002 and 2012", nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil]...
        irb> data.class
        => Array
        irb> data[4]
        => ["Canada", "2529", "1862", "2.4", "1.4"]
        irb> data[4].class
        => Array
        irb> data[4][0]
        => "Canada"
        irb> data[4][0].class
        => String
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Array ranges

        We can also select a range of items from an array by specifying the indices of the first and the last item:

        ```ruby
        irb> require 'csv'
        irb> data = CSV.read('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        irb> data[4..6]
        => [["Canada", "2529", "1862", "2.4", "1.4"],
            ["Australia", "1586", "1707", "2.4", "2"],
            ["Japan", "2151", "1627", "0.6", "0.4"]]
        irb> data[4][0..2]
        => ["Canada", "2529", "1862"]
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Looping over Arrays

        We can loop over items in an Array. This means we can loop over selected rows in CSV data!


        ```ruby
        require 'csv'
        data = CSV.read('./exercises/no-emissions.csv')
        for row in data[3..35]
            country = row[0]
            emissions2002 = row[1]
            if emissions2002 != nil
              puts "In 2002 " + country + " emitted " + emissions2002 + " kilotonnes."
            end
        end
        ```

        Sometimes we need to work with messy data. Above, we selected only relevant rows (3 to 35), and avoided printing that pesky row that separates the two sets of countries.

        You'll find the file **ex4_emissions_comparison.rb** in the **exercises** folder filled with comments. Apply what we've learned so far, as suggested by the comments.

        ```ruby
        # Require the csv library

        # Read the file 'no-emissions.csv' using the library

        # Loop through the rows 3 to 35

            # Go to next row if second column is empty

            # Compare the integer in the second column (row[1]) with the integer in the third column (row[2])

        # Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened.

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. Ruby processes everything to the right of the equals symbol (`=`) before assigning the result.

        ```ruby
        irb> count = 0
        irb> count = count + 1
        irb> print count
        => 1
        ```
        We can count the number of countries in **no-emissions.csv** if we increase by one for each row we loop over.

        ```ruby
        # file: exercises/demo_loop_count.rb
        require 'csv'

        count = 0

        for row in CSV.read("no-emissions.csv")
            # Ignore irrelevant rows
            if row[1].to_i > 0
              count += 1
            end
        end

        puts "There are " + count.to_s + " countries in the survey."

        # Finding a word in a string

        So far, we've compared entire strings to each other `"ruby" == "ruby"`.  
        But what if you want to check for a word inside an existing string?

        Ruby has an `.include?()` method available on `string` types that tells you if another string appears â€“ it returns a **boolean**.

        ```ruby
        irb> "Ladies Learning Code".include?("Code")
        => true
        ```

        The `.include?()` function is case-sensitive â€“Â it will only match the *exact* string you pass it, even if the only difference is `C` vs `c`.

        Now that you know how to find a string within a string, we are going to look at some more data!
        We are going to switch to using the file rent-data.csv, which is the file we will use in our final project!

        If you open the **rent-data.csv** file you can see that both provinces and cities are listed for the historical rent data.

        Remember, `.include?()` returns 'true' if the search string is in the row and 'false' if it is not.

        Open **ex5_city_rent_comparison.rb** and use what you've learned to find the rent prices in neighboring cities.

        * Print a list of cities in your chosen provinces
        * Print the city with the most expensive rent

        Out of curiousity we are going to take a look at historical rent prices using data from [open.canada.ca.](http://open.canada.ca/).

        Open **final_exercise.rb** and complete the exercise:

        * Complete a function that computes the **average rent** in a chosen **decade** for a chosen province and rental unit type.
        * Find the **difference** between the average rent in the **1980s** and in the **1990s**.
        *  **Bonus Exercise**: Use **selection sort** to sort a list of provinces from the highest to the lowest average rent.
